## Repository Contents:

### Model State Determination and Reduction:
1. Number of model states depends on the environment size.
2. Reducing states through equivalence of certain positions.

### Concepts and Components:
1. States: Correspond to agent positions in the environment.
2. Actions: Define agent movements - "up", "down", "left", "right".
3. Rewards: Define penalties and incentives.
4. Goal State: End point to reach, marked as "T".

### Learning Rate (α) Impact:
1. Speed of convergence and oscillation.
2. Exploration vs. exploitation balance.
3. Stabilization and solution accuracy.

### Discount Factor (γ) Impact:
1. Long-term vs. short-term rewards.
2. Optimal policy and goal emphasis.
3. Convergence and temporal consistency.
